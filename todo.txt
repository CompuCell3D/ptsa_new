Short-term goals
----------------

1) Rereferencing code (may not be immediately necessary)

2) WICA eyeblink correction code (and also simple eyeblink id code).

3) Save DimArray to HDF5 files (and back with fancy indexing).

4) Redo DimArray and Dim to have Pythonic indexing:
   
   x[(x.time > 0)&(x.time < 1.0)&(x.channels == 'Cz')]

   instead of

   x['(time > 0)&(time < 1.0)', 'channels == "Cz"']

5) Casting of HDF5Wrapper to int16 with scale factor to save space.

6) Fix topoplot issues (look at PyMVPA for hints).

7) Partial Least Squares

8) 




Redo fancy 3D scalp and intracranial plots using VTK (for
publications and other fun stuph.)

Circular stats, for analyzing phase info.

Simple stats, such as bootstraps/permutation tests.  The wilcox tests
in scipy are kind of not ideal.  However, we can use rpy for any stats
we really care about.

Add in EMD and Hilbert-Huang Transform. (In progress)

Frequency flows analysis.

Maybe add in multitaper at some point, but probably not.

Methods for extracting sync pulses and aligning events. (DONE)

Artifact removal (blink detection, artifact correction)


Basic workflow:

 - We have a bunch of subjects who performed some task.
 - Events for each subject, allow us to access the eeg data.
 - Calculate phase and power for eeg, saving to file (for now, we'll
 - save to dictionaries, eventually HDF5)
 - Run stats on power values.
 - Plot/display results.

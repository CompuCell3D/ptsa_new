What do we want in ptsa?

1) Finish unit tests.
   a) make sure all code is tested
   b) clean up existing unit tests.



Testing of code.

Save to files.  For right now we will just save to pickle files using
the numpy.dump and numpy.save and load them with numpy.load.  The
negative of this is that they are not very portable (sometimes you can
not move them to different machines.)

Redo fancy 3D scalp and intracranial plots using VTK (for
publications and other fun stuph.)

Circular stats, for analyzing phase info.

Simple stats, such as bootstraps/permutation tests.  The wilcox tests
in scipy are kind of not ideal.  However, we can use rpy for any stats
we really care about.

Add in EMD and Hilbert-Huang Transform. (In progress)

Frequency flows analysis.

Maybe add in multitaper at some point, but probably not.

Methods for extracting sync pulses and aligning events.

Artifact removal (blink detection, ...)


Basic workflow:

 - We have a bunch of subjects who performed some task.
 - Events for each subject, allow us to access the eeg data.
 - Calculate phase and power for eeg, saving to file (for now, we'll
 - save to dictionaries, eventually HDF5)
 - Run stats on power values.
 - Plot/display results.

Development guidelines
======================

- All new functionality must include testing. Modifying existing functionality
  that is not already tested also requires adding testing.
- Don't commit directly to master; make a separate branch and submit a pull
  request instead.
- Run tests before merging into master
- Python 3 is the present and future. Use this cheatsheet_ for tips on writing
  code that is compatible with legacy Python 2 and modern Python 3.
